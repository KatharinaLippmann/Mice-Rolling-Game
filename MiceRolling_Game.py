"""
In this program I want to simulate a simple game which already exists in real life.
In this game you usally have two figurines which you throw and depending on the way they land you get points.
After each throw one can decide if to throw again or to pass, as long as the previous throw wasn't the one throw which let's you lose the game.
The different results will be represented by ASCII-mice.
The possible throws for one mouse are:
looking left, looking right, laying on its back (laying), only showing the bum (bum), sitting and showing the face upfront (face).
The rules are as follows:
You always lose all your gathered points if one mouse is looking left while the other one is looking right, as well as the other way around.
When both mice are doing the same your points are being doubled, except both are looking in the same direction, which just gives you no additional points.
In all the other cases the points of the mice are looked at and added individually as follows:

    looking left= 0 points
 _  _
(o)(o)--.
 \../ (  )____/
 m\/m--m


    looking right = 0 points
        _  _
    .--(o)(o)
\___(  )\../
     m--m\/m


    laying = 5 points
 ____  w--w/\w
/    (  ) /°°\
      `--(o)(o)
          ?  ?


    bum = 5 points
  q-p
 /   \
(     )
 `-(-'
    )


    face = 10 points
  q-p
 /\"/\
(`=*=')
 ^---^`-._


This game is some kind of a simple gamble game and the goal is to get as many points as possible.
